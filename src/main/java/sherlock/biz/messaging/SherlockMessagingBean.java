/*
 * SherlockMessagingBean is used to receive messages of various types  from  the  SherlockDataLoader and is then used to 
 * pass on to the Complex Event Processor runtime. We have modelled every Sherlock Service such as Rules Engine as also
 * the Complex Event Processing service. 
 * 
 * Since we wanted to demo Sherlock using a layered architecutre in Brainwaves 2015, we had created this as class:
 * 
 * Data Loader(s) > Message Oriented Middleware > Complex Event Processing > UI
 *
 * [Core Java]		[HornetQ]						[Wildfly]			[Tomcat]
 * 
 * 
 * This is a very much real-world enterprise scneario for high volume  and  real time processing architecture - we may 
 * plan to use  high throughput messaging like Apache Kafka or even Apache Spark.
