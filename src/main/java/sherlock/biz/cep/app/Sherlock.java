/*
 * This is the demoable version of the Data  Loader to  continuously pump events into the core Sherlock! application. We 
 * demonstrate Sherlock!  Complex  Event Processing by using this data  loader. It  has  some  intelligence  in  that it 
 * creates data that is truly random but meets criteria so that we can  demo the use-cases  within  the  stipulated demo 
 * time of the hackathon.
 *    
 * Takes a Configurable Constant  for Number of Threads that can be Spawned. Spawns threads, Generates  Intelligent Data 
 * for Every Thread at  the Rate of 1 - 20 Java Objects Per Second. The Resulting Java Objects will be sent to Messaging 
 * Services
